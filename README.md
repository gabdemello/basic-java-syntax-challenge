# Java Basic Track

## Syntax - Challenge

The challenge is to create a project named ContaBanco that will receive data via the terminal containing the characteristics of a bank account according to the attributes below:

Within the project, create the ContaTerminal.java class to perform all the coding for our program.
Review variable declaration rules.
</br>

Attribute       | Type      | Example
--------------- | --------- | --------
Number          | Integer   | 1021
Agency          | Text      | 067-8
Client Name     | Text      | MARIO ANDRADE
Balance         | Decimal   | 237.48
</br>

Review about terminal, main args, and the Scanner class.
Allow the data to be entered via the terminal, where the user will receive a message requesting specific information, for example:
Program: "Please enter the Agency number!"
User: 1021 (then ENTER for the next field)
</br>

Review concatenation and the String class with the concat method.
After all the information has been entered, the system should display the following message:
"Hello [Client Name], thank you for creating an account with our bank. Your agency is [Agency], account [Number], and your balance [Balance] is now available for withdrawal."
</br>

The fields in [ ] should be replaced by the information entered by the users.
